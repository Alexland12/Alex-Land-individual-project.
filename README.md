This repository contains the full, complete code for my third year individual project.
The code was imported from google colab and can be found in the file 'FINAL_CODE'
Full explanation of the code can be found within the project report - however, a short user guide is below.

The main code, FINAL_CODE, should be opened via colab as prompted when the file is opened.
The code should be ran systematically, working though in order. There are prompts where neccessary how it works.
The second code, FINAL PROJECT CODE, is used for generating the space pressed variable.
When prompted, the space pressed variable should be copy and pasted into the processed data set - if re training the network is neccessary.

If you just want to test the program, this can be skipped and the processed data file can just be ran in the final section of FINAL_CODE.
In doing so, the trained network will make predictions on how much added time should be added to the football game.
(colours of team kits are required to be manually input into the second block of code)
